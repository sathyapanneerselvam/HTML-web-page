    <h3>Intersting facts about me</h3>
    <p>Pineapples do not grow on trees. Instead, they grow from leafy pineapple plants that are rooted into the ground. Unlike other fruit, you do not need seeds to grow a pineapple. In fact, if you want to grow your own pineapple, you can just twist the crown off a pineapple and plant it into the ground.</p>
